    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Minecraft was written in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java programming language</a> so your mod is also going to be written in Java. This has certain implications for your work:  <!-- more --></p>

<p>First, of course, you are going to have to know Java. The good news is that it is not difficult to gain a working knowledge of Java. The bad news is that Java is difficult to master. In addition to learning the Java programming language, I highly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321356683/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321356683&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=killentime-20">Effective Java</a> by Joshua Bloch.</p>

<p>Second, while it is possible to develop in Java using a text editor, I find an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an invaluable tool. I use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/moreinfo/java.php">Eclipse</a> because it is (1) <em>free</em>, (2) supported by Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP) and (3) contains very powerful features.</p>

<h2>Using Eclipse</h2>

<p>Setting up your project in Eclipse is simple: Open the MCP Eclipse project (found at forge/mcp/eclipse) and then add the source and resource directories (created <a href="/blog/2012/12/13/organization-and-revision-control/">last time</a>) to the buildpath. (I won't tell you how to do it...you've got to get familiar with Eclipse!)</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If everything is set up properly, you will be able to play minecraft from the Eclipse 'Run' menu.</p>

<p>This will be the last of the basic "How-To" style posts. Beginning next time, we will be discussing the specifics of ExtrabiomesXL 4 design.</p>
