I develop the [ExtrabiomesXL](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1090288-) mod for Minecraft. Recently, I realized that to make the mod what it should be, it needed to be rewritten. I created this blog to help you follow along in the process.

I have created a [repository](https://github.com/ScottKillen/ebxl4) for the project on [github.com](http://github.com). The code is open source and the idea is that you can clone or fork the project and follow along here. Most modding is not difficult, but it can be complicated. It is my hope that this blog will help you to understand how mods work and, if you're into such things, how to write a mod of your own. Test.
