Setting up the mod development environment used to be a complicated set of steps, but with recent developments in Minecraft Forge, it has become very easy. <!-- more -->

Here are the steps:

1. Create a folder for your project.
2. Go to [http://files.minecraftforge.net/](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) and download the latest Forge source (the "src" link).
3. Open the .zip file you downloaded and put the *forge* directory into the project folder you created, like so:

    ![forge folder](/images/screens/GettingStarted/1.png)

4. Enter the forge folder.
5. Run `install.cmd` in Windows or `install.sh` in Linux/MacOS

At this point, Minecraft Forge will take over, downloading everything it needs to decompile Minecraft and set up a development environment.
