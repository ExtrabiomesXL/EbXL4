You may have seen my post on twitter of mountainous terrain generated high above the clouds. Here is how it was done: <!-- more -->

Well, before that, let's take a look at the image itself:

Notice that we are standing at y=137 and terrain is towering over us above the clouds. The screenshot was generated by spawning a new world and snapping the shot.

"But wait, Minecraft doesn't generate terrain above y=127," you may say. You'd be right. What you are looking at is terrain generated by a complete terrain generator replacement.

Several days ago, my friend [MineCrak told me](https://github.com/ExtrabiomesXL/ExtrabiomesXL/issues/225) about the [TerrainControl](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/terrain-control/) bukkit plugin cum forge mod. I finally got around to investigating it and knew it was the ideal solution for the ExtrabiomesXL. I spoke to Khoorn, the mod maintainer, to confirm the licensing. His reply: "Yes, TerrainControl is completely free.  So you may use it as you want," had me hopping around the house with extra Christmas spirit. This is the power of opensource software!

The TerrainControl team has done an amazing job producing the mod. The code is very nicely written and documented and is designed to be modular. I spent a few hours repackaging TerrainControl so that I could make changes and everything would still work if someone also installed TerrainControl itself alongside ExtrabiomesXL.

TerrainControl contains more features than I can list. The TerrainControl wiki lists some [here](https://github.com/Wickth/TerrainControl/wiki/Features). In addition, TerrainControl has a feature requested by many ExtrabiomesXL players: terrain generation parameters are saved *by world*.

## Impact on ExtrabiomesXL 4

The integration of TerrainControl means a shortening of the development timetable for ExtrabiomesXL 4. Instead of writing a terrain generator from scratch (which would've been my first) I can focus on tweaking the generator and adding the content you have all been wanting.

I can't wait.
